        <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">Pluma Chain is not just another Layer 3; it's an experience. We're blending cutting-edge blockchain technology with the vibrant, imaginative world of anime to create a platform that's both powerful and delightful to use. This post explores how our unique approach to L3 scaling is set to revolutionize the dApp landscape.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-primary">The Featherweight Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">At the heart of Pluma Chain is our "featherweight" philosophy. This means minimizing computational overhead, reducing gas fees to near-zero, and ensuring transactions are processed at lightning speed. We achieve this through a novel modular rollup architecture that leverages Ethereum's L1 security while optimizing for L3 efficiency.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-primary">Anime: More Than Just Aesthetics</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">For Pluma Chain, anime isn't just a visual theme; it's a core part of our community and user experience strategy. We believe that by making blockchain technology more approachable, fun, and relatable, we can onboard the next wave of users and developers. Our mascot, Pluma-chan, and the entire Pluma Flock are here to guide you on your journey.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">From our developer documentation styled like a light novel to community events featuring anime artists, every aspect of Pluma Chain is designed to be engaging. We're building an ecosystem where creativity flourishes, and where building dApps feels like embarking on an exciting adventure.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-6 text-primary">What's Next for Pluma?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">The journey is just beginning! We're continuously working on new features, partnerships, and community initiatives.
